# ChatBot

This is a Chatbot that i made - it called 'Eilon's Chatbot'!

#### Features
- Netural language conversation much before neural-network-based models existed.
- Identifies the subject of the scentence.
- Remembers information from the conversation and stores in a DB.
- Can answer questions accourding to the memories.
- Commands like `help` and `exit`.

I implemented all the NLP logic myself without external libraries.

Have fun using it!

(It's the Chatbot.py file)

Sincerely,
Eilon
